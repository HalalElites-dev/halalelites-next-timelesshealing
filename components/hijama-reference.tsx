        <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
          Ibn Qayim mentioned in his book **At-Tibb An-Nabawiyy** (Prophetic Medicine) the fundamental principles of medicine. These principles are: preservation of health, prevention of harm, and removal of harmful substances. He also stated that if a person is afflicted with an illness, it is upon them to seek a cure. Cupping (Hijama) is one of the most effective cures for removing harm from the body.

        <p className="mt-4 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
          Hijama originated in China and was a well-known practice among the Arabs even before Islam. The Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) further encouraged its use, saying: **&quot;The best of that with which you can be treated is Hijamah.&quot;**

        <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
          This well-known practice is highly effective in curing many different types of illnesses, including **diabetes, migraines, back pain, and asthma**. However, it&apos;s essential for a believer to place complete trust in Allah while taking the necessary means to cure themselves. It has been established that every sickness, except for death, has been sent down with its cure, and it is upon every individual to seek it.

        <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
          The religion of Islam emphasizes good health and encourages people to appreciate it. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: **“There are two blessings which many people are duped out of: good health and free time.”** This means many are deprived of taking full advantage of these immense blessings. He also advised: **“Take advantage of five before five: your youth before old age, your health before your illness, your wealth before your poverty...”**

      <div id="terminology" className="py-12 border-b border-gray-200">
        <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-foreground mb-4">Hijamah: Terminology and Practice</h2>
        <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
          The word **Hijama** is an Arabic word originating from **Hajm**, which means **&quot;to suck.&quot;** In English, it&apos;s often referred to as wet cupping and is distinct from bloodletting.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-4 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
          <li>**Hijama** removes stagnant blood from beneath the skin&apos;s surface, carefully avoiding veins.</li>
          <li>**Bloodletting** extracts blood from veins and arteries, making it a more invasive procedure.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mt-4 text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
          As referenced by Ibn al-Qayyim, Hijama is better for purifying the outer layer of the body, while bloodletting is more suitable for deeper, more systemic ailments.

        <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-foreground mb-4">Instruments and Modern Practice</h2>
        <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
          Historically, various tools were used for Hijama, including hollowed animal horns, bamboo, clay, and glass. Today, modern, sterile equipment is used. The incisions for wet cupping have also evolved from chiseled stones to modern surgical blades. The safest method today is using mechanical plastic cups and pumps.

        <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-foreground mb-4">Recommended Days for Hijama</h2>
        <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
          Based on the Hadith of Ibn Abbas, the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said: **“The best days upon which you can be cupped are the 17th, the 19th, and the 21st.”** A similar narration from Abu Hurayrah states that cupping on these days is a remedy for every ailment. No authentic narrations prohibit Hijama on other days.

        <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-foreground mb-4">Does Hijama Nullify Wudu?</h2>
        <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
          Based on the Hadith of Anas ibn Malik, the Prophet (ﷺ) was cupped and did not perform Wudu afterward. Sheikh Muhammad ibn Salih Al-Uthaymeen explained that what comes out of the body does not nullify Wudu, except for that which exits from the private passages. He stated that the one who claims it breaks Wudu must provide evidence.
